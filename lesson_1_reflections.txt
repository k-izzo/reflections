We know that the bug exists in one file but not the other. But where? The natural approach might be to start with the file that we know is bug free and check whether the corresponding lines in the buggy file match. Even if the files are structured such that each line in f1 lines neatly with its counterpart in line 2, we will have to check 2 times the number of lines in each file in the worst case. A more efficient approach might involved dividing the files into sections, and only examining the lines within a section if we cannot guarantee that the bug is not within them (via a print statement, perhaps). We would want to start with the sections we are most skeptical of first. Another apprach coud be to use a naive bisection search over the entire space of the documents. Obviously an automatic detection of the differences would speed up any of these approaches. Which is why we use diff programs and version control systems.
