When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The remote repo seems most useful when collaborating with others. Maybe with colleagues during a private project, or with the community if the project is open source. The remote repo could also be useful when we are no longer developing a project but wish to store it and make it available (and findable) for those who might be interested. Maybe there are also cases when we don't care about collaboration or sharing but the remote repo still provides value to the individual developer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes to a branch we are working on might interfere with our work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are specific to GitHub. They are useful when you want to move someone's repo over to your account. You can then edit it via the GitHub GUI or clone it to your local machine. The  forked repo retains a link to the rep and account it was forked from. If you clone it to your own machine, the local repo will automatically be linked to the remote repo under the default name "origin".

Clones are a way to pull work from a remote repo onto your local machine. From there you can edit it in your text editor of choice, save versions locally, make commits, and update the remote repo as you see fit. If you are collaborating with a few colleagues one of them might set up a remote repo and send out it's location. Then everyone can clone to their local machines and start development. They can push to the remote repo when they're ready with new features or whatever, and they can pull others' changes to their local machine as necessary.

Branches are a way to manage sets related paths of a programs as they are being developed (often simultanously). They are a means to organzie code and separate features, bug fixes, whatever from the main/core/master branch that can be merged later if necessary.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The local copy of the remote allows us to interact with the remote even when we are not connected to the hosted/cloud version. When we know that we will be offline we can git fetch to update the local copy of the remote without actually merging the contents of the remote with our local repo. This is another intermidiary layer, maybe similar to the staging component of our local repo. It gives us more flexibility.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

For simple projects I can imagine situations where it would be easier to collaborate without Git and GitHub. Maybe one person is writing the bulk of the code and another is reviewing it from time to time and making comments. In a situation like this the code can be hosted anywhere and the communication can be done via phone, chat, in-person, whatever. There is some setup/overhead required for establishing a git/GitHub like system which might be avoidable in this type of situation. This is especially true if any of the developers are not familiar with git. But for more complex projects, and especially when team memebers are working remotely and possibly in different time zones, it makes sense to use a proper version control system. And GitHub's GUI platform and automatically triggered alerts seem to complement the base git system nicely.
